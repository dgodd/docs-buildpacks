Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications.
Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artifacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services.

When you push an application, Cloud Foundry automatically [detects](./detection.html) which buildpack is required and installs it on the Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) where the application needs to run.

## Dependencies ##

Cloud Foundry deployments often have limited access to dependencies.
This limitation occurs when the deployment is behind a firewall, or
when administrators want to use local mirrors and proxies.
In these circumstances, Cloud Foundry provides a
[Buildpack Packager](https://github.com/cf-buildpacks/buildpack-packager) application.

The following topics also contain information that might be relevant to your deployment:

* [Supported Binary Dependencies](./supported-binary-dependencies.html) topic.
* [Packaging Dependencies for Offline Buildpacks](./depend-pkg-offline.html)

## System Buildpacks

This table describes Cloud Foundry system buildpacks. Each buildpack row lists supported languages and frameworks and includes a GitHub repo link. Specific buildpack names also link to additional documentation.

## Other Buildpacks

If your application uses a language or framework that Cloud Foundry buildpacks do not support, you can try the following:

* Customize an existing buildpack, or create your own [custom buildpack](./custom.html).
  <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A common development practice for custom buildpacks is to fork existing buildpacks and sync subsequent patches from upstream. To merge upstream patches to your custom buildpack, use the approach that Github recommends for <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork">syncing a fork</a>.</p>

* Use a [Cloud Foundry Community Buildpack][c].
* Use a [Heroku Third-Party Buildpack][h].
