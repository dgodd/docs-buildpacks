_This page assumes you are using cf CLI v6._

This topic provides Node-specific information to supplement the general guidelines in the [Deploy an Application](../../devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html) topic.

## <a id='packagejson'></a> Application Package File ##

Cloud Foundry expects a `package.json` in your Node.js application.
You can specify the version of Node.js you want to use in the `engine` node of
your `package.json` file.
As of July, 2015, and buildpack version 1.5.0, Cloud Foundry uses Node.js version 0.12.7 by default.
See the GitHub [Node.js buildpack page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack) for current information.

Example `package.json` file:

~~~JSON
{
  "name": "first",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "author": "Demo",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "3.4.8",
    "consolidate": "0.10.0",
    "express": "3.4.8",
    "swig": "1.3.2"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": "0.12.7",
    "npm": "2.7.4"
  }
}
~~~

## <a id='port'></a> Application Port ##

You must use the PORT environment variable to determine which port your
application should listen on.
In order to also run your application locally, you may want to make port 3000
the default:

~~~javascript

app.listen(process.env.PORT || 3000);

~~~

## <a id='start'></a> Application Start Command ##

Node.js applications require a start command.
You can specify a Node.js applications's web start command in a Procfile or in
the application deployment manifest.

You will be asked if you want to save your configuration the first time you
deploy.
This will save a `manifest.yml` in your application with the settings you
entered during the initial push.
Edit the `manifest.yml` file and create a start command as follows:

~~~yaml
---
applications:
- name: my-app
  command: node my-app.js
... the rest of your settings ...
~~~

Alternately, specify the start command with `cf push -c`.

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-app -c "node my-app.js"
</pre>

## <a id='nodemodules'></a> Application Bundling ##

You do not need to run `npm install` before deploying your application.
Cloud Foundry will run it for you when your application is pushed.
If you would prefer to run `npm install` and create a `node_modules` folder
inside of your application, this is also supported.

## <a id='discovery'></a> Solving Discovery Problems ##

If Cloud Foundry does not automatically detect that your application is a
Node.js application, you can override the auto-detection by specifying the
Node.js buildpack.

Add the buildpack into your `manifest.yml` and re-run `cf push` with your
manifest:

~~~yaml
---
applications:
- name: my-app
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack
... the rest of your settings ...
~~~

Alternately, specify the buildpack on the command line with `cf push -b`:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack
</pre>

## <a id='services'></a> Binding Services ##

Refer to [Configure Service Connections for Node.js](./node-service-bindings.html).

## <a id='buildpack'></a> About the Node.js Buildpack ##

For information about using and extending the Node.js buildpack in Cloud
Foundry, see the [nodejs-buildpack repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack).

You can find current information about this buildpack on the Node.js buildpack [release page](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack/releases) in GitHub.

The buildpack uses a default Node.js version of `0.12.7`. To specify the versions of Node.js and npm an application requires, edit the applicationâ€™s `package.json`, as described in "node.js and npm versions" in the [nodejs-buildpack repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack).

## <a id='env-var'></a>Environment Variables ##

You can access environments variable programmatically.

For example, you can obtain `VCAP_SERVICES` like this:

```
process.env.VCAP_SERVICES
```

Environment variables available to you include both those [defined by the system]
(../../devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#app-system-env)
and those defined by the Node.js buildpack, as described below.

### <a id='BUILD-DIR'></a>BUILD_DIR ###
Directory into which Node.js is copied each time a Node.js application is run.

### <a id='CACHE-DIR'></a>CACHE_DIR ###

Directory that Node.js uses for caching.

### <a id='PATH'></a>PATH ###

The system path used by Node.js.

`PATH=/home/vcap/app/bin:/home/vcap/app/node_modules/.bin:/bin:/usr/bin`
