Buildpacks are a convenient way of packaging framework and/or runtime support
for your application.

For example, by default Cloud Foundry does not support Haskell. Using a buildpack for Haskell allows you to add support for it at the deployment stage. When you push an application written using Haskell, the required buildpack is automatically installed on the Cloud Foundry Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) where the application will run.

 <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A common development practice for custom buildpacks is to fork existing buildpacks and sync subsequent patches from upstream. To merge upstream patches to your custom buildpack, use the approach that Github recommends for <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork">syncing a fork</a>.</p>

## <a id='custom-buildpacks'></a>Custom Buildpacks ##

The structure of a buildpack is straightforward. A buildpack repository contains three main scripts, situated in a folder named `bin`.

### <a id='detect-script'></a>bin/detect ###

The `detect` script is used to determine whether or not to apply the buildpack to an application. The script is called with one argument, the build directory for the application. It returns an exit code of `0` if the application can be supported by the buildpack. If the script does return `0`, it should also print a framework name to STDOUT.

Shown below is an example `detect` script written in Ruby that checks for a Ruby application based on the existence of a `Gemfile`:

~~~ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

gemfile_path = File.join ARGV[0], "Gemfile"

if File.exist?(gemfile_path)
  puts "Ruby"
  exit 0
else
  exit 1
end

~~~

Note that cf CLI displays the returned STDOUT "framework name" when printing the details of an application. Buildpack authors are therefore encouraged to include additional details in this returned framework name, such as buildpack versioning information, and a detailed list of configured frameworks and their associated versions. The following is an example of the detailed information returned by the Java buildpack:

~~~
java-buildpack=v3.0-https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git#3bd15e1 open-jdk-jre=1.8.0_45 spring-auto-reconfiguration=1.7.0_RELEASE tomcat-access-logging-support=2.4.0_RELEASE tomcat-instance=8.0.21 tomcat-lifecycle-support=2.4.0_RELEASE ...
~~~

### <a id='compile-script'></a>bin/compile ###

The `compile` script builds the droplet that will be run by the DEA and will therefore contain all the components necessary to run the application.

The script is run with two arguments, the build directory for the application and the cache directory, which is a location the buildpack can use to store assets during the build process.

During execution of this script all output sent to STDOUT will be relayed via the cf CLI back to the end user. The generally accepted pattern for this is to break out this functionality in to a 'language_pack'. A good example of this can be seen at [https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-ruby/blob/master/lib/language_pack/ruby.rb](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/heroku-buildpack-ruby/blob/master/lib/language_pack/ruby.rb)

A simple `compile` script is shown below:

~~~ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby

#sync output

$stdout.sync = true

build_path = ARGV[0]
cache_path = ARGV[1]

install_ruby

private

def install_ruby
  puts "Installing Ruby"

  # !!! build tasks go here !!!
  # download ruby to cache_path
  # install ruby
end

~~~

### <a id='release-script'></a>bin/release ###

The `release` script provides feedback metadata back to Cloud Foundry indicating how the application should be executed. The script is run with one argument, the build location of the application. The script must generate a YAML file in the following format:

~~~yaml
  config_vars:
    name: value
  default_process_types:
    web: commandLine
~~~

Where `config_vars` is an optional set of environment variables that will be defined in the environment in which the application is executed. `default_process_types` indicates the type of application being run and the command line used to start it. At this time only `web` type of applications are supported.

The following example shows what a Rack application's `release` script might return:

~~~ruby

config_vars:
  RACK_ENV: production
default_process_types:
  web: bundle exec rackup config.ru -p $PORT

~~~

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>web</code> command runs as <code>bash -c COMMAND</code> when Cloud Foundry starts your application. Refer to <a href="../devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#start-commands">the command attribute</a> section for more information about custom start commands. </p>

## <a id='disconnected-environments'></a> Droplet Filesystem ##

The buildpack staging process extracts the droplet into the `/home/vcap` directory inside the instance container, and creates the following filesystem tree:

```
app/ 
logs/
tmp/
staging_info.yml
```
The `app` directory contains `BUILD_DIR` contents, and `staging_info.yml` contains the staging metadata saved in the droplet.

### Partially or completely disconnected environments

Cloud Foundry buildpacks work with limited or no internet connectivity. A Cloud Foundry operator can enable the same support in
your custom buildpack by using the [Buildpack Packager](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager) application.

#### Using buildpack-packager
1. Create a manifest.yml in your buildpack.
1. Run the packager in cached mode: `buildpack-packager cached`

The packager will add (almost) everything in your buildpack directory into a zip file. It will exclude anything marked for exclusion in your manifest.

In cached mode, the packager will download and add dependencies as described in the manifest.

Option Flags

`--force-download`

By default, buildpack-packager stores the dependencies that it downloads while building a cached buildpack in a local cache at `~/.buildpack-packager`. This is in order to avoid re-downloading them when repackaging similar buildpacks. Running `buildpack-packager cached` with the `--force-download` option will force the packager to download dependencies from the s3 host and ignore the local cache. When packaging an uncached buildpack, `--force-download` does nothing.

`--use-custom-manifest`

If you would like to include a different manifest file in your packaged buildpack, you may call buildpack-packager with the `--use-custom-manifest PATH/TO/MANIFEST.YML` option. buildpack-packager will generate a buildpack with the specified manifest. If you are building a cached buildpack, buildpack-packager will vendor dependencies from the specified manifest as well.

You can find more documentation at the [buildpack-packager Github repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/buildpack-packager).

#### Uploading the buildpack

Once you have packaged your buildpack using `buildpack-packager`, you can upload the resulting `.zip` file to your instance of Cloud Foundry:

`cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK_NAME BUILDPACK_ZIP_PATH POSITION`

<%=vars.link_adminguid_buildpack%>

## <a id='deploying-with-custom-buildpacks'></a>Deploying With a Custom Buildpack ##

Once a custom buildpack has been created and pushed to a public git repository, the git URL can be passed via the cf CLI when pushing an application.

For example, for a buildpack that has been pushed to Github:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b git://github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git
</pre>

Alternatively, you can use a private git repository, with https and username/password authentication, as follows:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://username:password@github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git
</pre>

By default, Cloud Foundry uses the master branch of the buildpack's git repository. You can specify a different branch using the git url as shown in the following example:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf push my-new-app -b https://username:password@github.com/johndoe/my-buildpack.git#my-branch-name
</pre>

The application will then be deployed to Cloud Foundry, and the buildpack will be cloned from the repository and applied to the application (provided that the `detect` script returns `0`).
